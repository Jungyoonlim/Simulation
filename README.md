- [x] DONE: Figure out why I can't have each model uploaded. (One by one!)
- [x] DONE: App.css fix. 
- [x] DONE: Better "Load Model" button.

- [x] DONE: Redirection to another page. (BrowserRouter, two new pages: ModelSelection and ModelDisplay) 
- [x] DONE: original colors for 3D models. 
- [x] DONE: how can I have the 3d model show 360 degrees. 
- [x] DONE: Better Lighting. 
- [x] DONE: CSS Fixes for prettier UI. 
- [x] DONE: Fix Buttons.

- [] IN-PROGRESS: Annotation Tracking, Shows on the website, Annotation Styling, Store. 
- [] TODO: Login (Probably Backend for this). 
- [] TODO: Build out database (PostgresSQL). 

- [] TODO: Integrating backend and frontend.

- [] TODO: Bring the Prototype 3D -> 2D Maps Logic. (Bring from PyQt Project)
- [] TODO: Collaboration - Like Git Version of this. 
- [] TODO: Users to Interact with 3D Model. (Need to think more on how to interact with the model)
- [] TODO: How can I make this a robotics full comprehensive software?
- [] TODO: Just by describing where to go in English, make the robot / 3D object to move. (Need to expand on this) 

Ideas
 - 3D Environmental Mapping: Use 3D modeling to map out terrains and underwater topographies, aiding in the study of habitats, tracking changes, and planning conservation efforts.
 - Have AI to assist in building 3D ?  
 - 3D Data Labeling
 - 3D NFT Artwork? (https://www.escherreality.com/nft-artwork/)
    

- [] TODO: LLM to build a 3D model? 
- [] TODO: What's useful software for robotics?
- [] TODO: Perception Related software but probably a separate project for that.
