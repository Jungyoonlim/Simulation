# Simulation: 3D Object Viewer and Annotator. 

## Overview 
This project aims to help users interact with 3D models. 

## Features
- 3D Model Viewing: Load and display `.obj` files within a 3D environment.
- Interactive Annotations: Add and manage annotations on 3D models with coordinates.
- Object Manipulation: Interact with and manipulate 3D objects within the scene.
- Backend: For storing annotations and 3D model data. 

## Planned Enhancements
1. Better Design 
    - Design Mockups with Figma
        - Wireframes
        - colors, typography, and detailed UI elements 
    - Annotations
    - UI/UX
        - Layout and Navigation
            - 1. Sidebar/Menu (Animation for this)
            - 2. Toolbar
            - 3. Responsive Design 
                - CSS Flexbox or Grid 
            - Use `Material-UI` or `@emotion/react` or `@emotion/styled`
2. Performance Optimization
    - Optimize 3D Rendering
    - Lazy Loading
