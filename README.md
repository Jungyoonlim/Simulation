# Simulation: 3D Object Viewer and Annotator. 

## Overview 
This project aims to play with 3D models. 

## Features
- 3D Model Viewing: Load and display `.obj` files within a 3D environment.
- Interactive Annotations: Add and manage annotations on 3D models with coordinates.
- Object Manipulation: Interact with and manipulate 3D objects within the scene.
- Backend: For storing annotations and 3D model data. 

## Planned Enhancements
1. UI/UX Improvements and Object Manipulation: Future versions will feature a more intuitive user interface and allow users to manipulate objects within the 3D scene.
3. Computer Vision for Automatic Annotations: Implement computer vision algorithms to automatically detect and annotate features within the 3D models.
