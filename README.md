# Simulation: 3D Robotics Simulation Engine.

## Overview 
This project aims to create an advanced 3D model viewer and annotator using `Three.js` and React. This tool is designed for developers and researchers focused on 3D objects, enabling the visualization and annotation. Our goal is to provide a platform that facilitates the development and testing of robotics algorithms, object manipulation, and scenario simulations. 

## Features
- 3D Model Viewing: Load and display `.obj` files within a 3D environment.
- Interactive Annotations: Add and manage annotations on 3D models with coordinates.
- Object Manipulation: Interact with and manipulate 3D objects within the scene.
- Backend: For storing annotations and 3D model data. 

## Planned Enhancements
1. UI/UX Improvements and Object Manipulation: Future versions will feature a more intuitive user interface and allow users to manipulate objects within the 3D scene.
3. Computer Vision for Automatic Annotations: Implement computer vision algorithms to automatically detect and annotate features within the 3D models.
