- [x] DONE: Figure out why I can't have each model uploaded. (One by one!)
- [x] DONE: App.css fix. 
- [x] DONE: Better "Load Model" button.

- [x] DONE: Redirection to another page. (BrowserRouter, two new pages: ModelSelection and ModelDisplay) 
- [x] DONE: original colors for 3D models. 
- [x] DONE: how can I have the 3d model show 360 degrees. 
- [x] DONE: Better Lighting. 
- [x] DONE: CSS Fixes for prettier UI.

- [] TODO: Find ways of using AI to unwrap. or learn some Computer Graphics. 
- [] TODO: Collaboration?
- [] TODO: Login (Probably Backend for this). 
- [] TODO: Build out database (PostgresSQL) to have users store their annotations on 3D models.
- [] TODO: Integration with Frontend. 
- [] TODO: Testing for backend and frontend.
- [] TODO: Users to Interact with 3D Model. (Need to think more on how to interact with the model)

  <summary>Ideas</summary>

  - Just by describing where to go in English, make the robot / 3D object move. (Need to expand on this)
  - 3D Environmental Mapping: Use 3D modeling to map out terrains and underwater topographies, aiding in the study of habitats, tracking changes, and planning conservation efforts.
  - What's useful software for robotics?
  - Perception Related software but probably a separate project for that.
  - Collaboration / Version Control for Robotics / 3D Design. 
  - Make Beautiful Things. For Light and Love.
